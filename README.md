### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

+ I am currently studying at Codecool, a year-long Full-stack Developer bootcamp @Budapest.
+ I am currently working on a few projects:
    + a custom webpack ReactJS / ExpressJS application, using PostgreSQL as its database, written entirely in Typescript.
    + a Java application that simulates a hundred years of lifecycles of animals living on the savannah.
+ A mighty fun fact: ```()()``` is not a palindrome but ```())(``` is.
